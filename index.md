Hi there! 

I'm Arne, an enthusiast of using Data-Driven Computational Methods to practically improve the health of people - think Visualization, Machine Learning and Computational Statistics. I'm deeply fascinated by learning in all its different forms. From Nutrition, the body and Cognitive Psychology to learning Jiu Jitsu and how cultural differences guide our lives.

Science and Engineering often pose questions that can only be addressed with complex data. Distilling and communciating meaning out of that data to improve people's lives yield amazing puzzles. I'll use this website to showcase some examples of how that can be done.

### My background

I started out with a BSc and MSc in Mathematics. I wanted to use the tools learnt there for Science and Engineering, and took this further in a Doctoral Training Program in Statistics at the Universities of Warwick and Oxford.

I've often been at the cross-section of different fields. During my Mathematics studies, I looked at the interplay between different subfields of Mathematics and Physics. Doing Statistics research, I was engaged with Personalised Medicine and Cognitive Psychology. It is a position I cherish, as it allows to make new connections that drive those fields.

I took a break from Machine Learning to explore more directly for others. It led me to look into [sustainable volunteering](http://blog.grassrootsvolunteering.org/independent-volunteer/). I worked as a [volunteer trek guide](https://www.quetzaltrekkers.com/xela/) in Guatemala for 4 months and travelled to get in touch with people of different backgrounds. 

As self-study projects, I've had a look at Neuroeconomics literature, metabolic health literature and Reinforcement Learning methodology.

Aside of that, I love the challenge of gym improvement, Jiu Jitsu, Climbing, cycling, reading and working with other people.
